# The Wild Oasis

<p text-align = "justify">
The Wild Oasis is a charming boutique hotel nestled in a serene location, offering 15 luxurious wooden cabins for a truly unforgettable stay.
To streamline their operations and enhance guest experiences, "The Wild Oasis" is embarking on a project to develop a custom-built Internal Hotel Management App.The main objective of this project is to create a comprehensive application that will handle all aspects of hotel management, including bookings, cabin availability, and guest information. The Internal Hotel Management App will serve as a central hub for hotel staff, providing them with the necessary tools to efficiently manage check-ins, handle reservations, and deliver exceptional customer service.The app will feature an intuitive dashboard that provides insightful analytics. The dashboard will be powered with charts and graphs, offering visual representations of key performance indicators. Hotel staff will be able to analyze total sales, track the number of prepaid customers, monitor the occupancy rate, and gain valuable insights into the hotel's performance.

## Main Features

- **User Authentication**: Only hotel employees can sign up and log into the application. New users can sign up within the app by other employees, ensuring that only authorized personnel have access. Users have the ability to upload an avatar and update their name and password.

- **Cabin Management**: The app includes a table view that displays all cabins with relevant details such as cabin photo, cabin id, capacity, price, and current discount. Users can update, delete, or create new cabins, including the ability to upload cabin photos.

- **Booking Management**: The app provides a comprehensive table view of all bookings, showing arrival and departure dates, booking status, paid amount, and associated cabin and guest data. The booking status can be filtered by "unconfirmed," "checked in," or "checked out." Additional booking data includes the number of guests, number of nights, guest observations, and breakfast information. Users can delete, update, create, check in, or check out a booking as guests arrive. On check-in, users can confirm payment receipt (outside the app) and add breakfast for the entire stay if necessary.

- **Guest Management**: The app also provides a comprehensive table view of all Guests, showing Their name, address, age, gender, diet-preference and nationality. Guests can be filtered by Gender and sorted by their age, name and many-more. users can create a new guest when they arrive, update their information or delete a guest when necessary.

It includes a list of guests checking in and out on the current day, statistics on recent bookings, sales, check-ins, number of pre-paid guests and occupancy rate. The dashboard also features charts displaying daily hotel sales (including extras) and stay duration statistics.

- **Application Settings**: Users can define application-wide settings such as breakfast price, minimum and maximum nights per booking, and maximum guests per booking.

-  **Dark Mode**: The app supports a dark mode option for enhanced user experience.
